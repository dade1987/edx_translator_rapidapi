# Edx Video Subtitle Translator

This project allows for automatic translation of video subtitles while playing. Follow the steps below to use this innovative solution:

## Instructions:

1. **Access the Video Page:**
   Navigate to the page of a video on a streaming platform.

2. **Open the Inspection Panel:**
   Right-click on a subtitle during video playback and select "Inspect" (or "Inspect Element") from the context menu.

3. **Copy Code from Console:**
   Go to the "Console" tab in the inspection window. Copy all the code from the [translator.js](translator.js) file (or provided code) and paste it into the console.

4. **Activate Translation:**
   Start playing the video. The injected code will automatically translate subtitles as they appear. This approach helps avoid API limits and ensures continuous translation.

## Important Note:

- **Rate Limiting:**
  Since this method avoids the rate limiting of translation APIs, only a limited amount of text can be translated at once. It is recommended not to load and translate large blocks of text simultaneously to ensure smooth operation.

- **Platform Tested:**
  This script has been tested on [Insert the name of the streaming platform] and may require modifications to work on other platforms.

## Disclaimer:

This project was created as an experiment and is not intended to violate any terms of service of the streaming platform. Please use responsibly and be aware of the platform's regulations.

## Contributions:

You are welcome to contribute to improving this solution and making it compatible with additional platforms or addressing any known issues.
